## Hi, I'm Isak ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from university in 2021 with a degree in international relations and philosophy. After graduating and spending some time interning in a few foreign policy ventures, I've decided to pivot my career towards software development. I'm wrapping up a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) and I'm currently looking for software engineering roles.

- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: Haskell and Microservice Architectures
- ðŸ”¨ Currently working on: [Polka payments](https://github.com/cdkini/qn), my own payments processor written from scratch
- ðŸ’» Passionate about functional programming, backend development, and [general computer science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) knowledge
